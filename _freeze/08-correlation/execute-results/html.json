With data from a few different sources examining the relationship\n    between the percentage of people in a country with water access and\n    the percentage of school-aged girls who are in school.\n2.  With data exploring the relationship between the percentage of\n    females in school and the percentage of people living on less than\n    \\$1 per day.\n\n## Resources & Chapter Outline\n\n### Data, codebook, and R packages {#sec-chap08-data-codebook-packages}\n\n::: my-resource\n::: my-resource-header\nData, codebook, and R packages for learning about descriptive statistics\n:::\n\n::: my-resource-container\n**Data**\n\nTwo options:\n\n1.

It’s similar to variance, but where variance tells you how a single variable varies, co variance tells you how two variables vary together. (Statistics How To(https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/covariance/))'>covariance</a>, which quantifies\nwhether two variables vary together (co-vary).\n\n::: my-theorem\n::: my-theorem-header\n::: {#thm-chap08-covariance}\n: Formula for covariance\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-theorem-container\n$$\ncov_{xy} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{(x_{i}-m_{x})(y_{i}-m_{y})}{n-1}\n$$ {#eq-chap08-covariance}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe numerator essentially adds up how far each observation is away from\nthe mean values of the two variables being examined, so this ends up\nbeing a very large number quantifying how far away all the observations\nare from the mean values. The denominator divides this by\n<a class='glossary' title='Bessel’s correction is the use of n − 1 instead of n in the formula for the sample variance and sample standard deviation, where n is the number of observations in a sample. This method corrects the bias in the estimation of the population variance. It also partially corrects the bias in the estimation of the population standard deviation. However, the correction often increases the mean squared error in these estimations. This technique is named after Friedrich Bessel. (Wikipedia)'>Bessel’s correction</a> (@sec-chap04-clt) of $n – 1$, which\nis close to the sample size and essentially finds the average deviation\nfrom the means for each observation.\n\nI skipped Figure 8.4 and 8.5 because they do not bring any news for me.\n(Note that there is a wrong label for x-axis in Figure 8.5: Instead of\n\"Percent living on less than \\$1 per day\" it says wrongly \"Percent with\nbasic water access\".)\n\n### Missing values\n\nThe covariance function `stats::cov()` is like the `base::mean()`\nfunction in that it cannot handle NA values. As we are going to\ncalculate `female.in.school` with `perc.basic2015water` and\n`female.in.school` with `perc.1dollar` we would have three different\nvariables with NA's.\n\nIt is important not to to remove all rows with missing data of all three\nvariables at the same time because that would delete more rows as for\neach pair of variable would be necessary. We know from\n@tbl-show-water-educ that\n\n-   `female.in.school` has no missing values\n-   `perc.basic2015water` has 1 missing value\n-   `perc.1dollar` has 33 missing values\n\nThere are two options:\n\na)  To use two different covariance calculations, each time with the\n    appropriate `tidyr::drop_na()` function as used finally in the book.\nb)  To apply the appropriate `use` argument of the `stats::cov()`\n    function for each calculations, which I will use and which was the\n    first try in the book.\n\n::: my-r-code\n::: my-r-code-header\n::: {#cnj-chap08-cov-female-water-pov}\n: Covariance of females in school and percentage with basic access to\ndrinking water\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-r-code-container\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwater_educ |> \n  dplyr::summarize(\n      cov_females_water = stats::cov(\n          x = perc.basic2015water,\n          y = female.in.school,\n          use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\",\n          method = \"pearson\"\n          ),\n      cov_females_pov = stats::cov(\n          x = perc.1dollar,\n          y = female.in.school,\n          use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\",\n          method = \"pearson\")\n      )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> # A tibble: 1 × 2\n#>   cov_females_water cov_females_pov\n#>               <dbl>           <dbl>\n#> 1              194.           -203.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe book argument for NA's is `use = \"complete\"` which is an allowed\nabbreviation for `use = \"complete.obs\"`. I have employed\n`use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\"` which is a more precise argument but\nworks only for the (default) \"pearson\" method.\n:::\n:::\n\n### Interpretation\n\nThe covariance does not have an intuitive inherent meaning; it is not a\npercentage or a sum or a difference. In fact, the size of the covariance\ndepends largely on the size of what is measured. For example, something\nmeasured in millions might have a covariance in the millions or hundreds\nof thousands. The value of the covariance indicates whether there is a\nrelationship at all and the direction of the relationship --- that is,\nwhether the relationship is positive or negative.\n\nIn this case, a nonzero value indicates that there is some relationship.\nIn the first case (`cov_females_water`) it is a positive relationship;\nin the second case (`cov_females_pov`) it is a negative relationship.\nThe size of the numbers are irrelevant!\n\nTherefore <a class='glossary' title='In statistics, standardization (also called Normalizing) is the process of putting different variables on the same scale. This process allows you to compare scores between different types of variables. Typically, to standardize variables, you calculate the mean and standard deviation for a variable. Then, for each observed value of the variable, you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. (Statistics by Jim) See scale() in R.  (Chap.4)'>standardization</a> by dividing by the\n<a class='glossary' title='The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. The standard deviation is the square root of its variance. A useful property of the standard deviation is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same unit as the data. Standard deviation may be abbreviated SD, and is most commonly represented in mathematical texts and equations by the lower case Greek letter \\(\\sigma\\) (sigma), for the population standard deviation, or the Latin letter \\(s\\) for the sample standard deviation.

For instance this assumption is met in @fig-graph2-cor. If it is difficult to tell, a <a class='glossary' title='Loess curve is a graph curve that shows the relationship between two variables without constraining the line to be straight; it can be compared to a linear fit line to determine whether the relationship is close to linear or not (= checking the [linearity] assumption). The procedure originated as LOWESS (LOcally WEighted Scatter-plot Smoother). is a nonparametric method because the linearity assumptions of conventional regression methods have been relaxed. It is called local regression because the fitting at say point x is weighted toward the data nearest to x. (SwR, Glossary and LOESS Curve Fitting (Local Polynomial Regression))'>Loess curve</a> can be added to confirm linearity as I have done it in @fig-graph1-cor.\n\nIt is instructive to see relationships that are non-linear. The next graph shows some relationships but they fall along curves instead of along straight lines.\n\n![Examples for nonlinear relationships](img/chap08/Nonlinear-relationships-min.png){#fig-nonlinear-relations\nfig-alt=\"The two variables seen in these two graphs are labeled x and y and are on the x and y axes respectively. Both graphs have a linear fit line as well as a less curve. The graph on the left titled 1, has x axis values that range from -10 to 5, in intervals of 5. The values on the y axis range from -100, to 100, in intervals of 50. The linear fit line in this graph is a horizontal line at the y axis value of about 30. The loess curve joins the data points in this graph in a U-shape with the midpoint at about (0, 0). The graph on the right titled 2, has x axis values that range from -10 to 5, in intervals of 5. The values on the y axis range from -100, to 100, in intervals of 50. The linear fit line in this graph is an upward-sloping line that starts at about (-65, -10) and ends at about (65, 10). The loess curve joins the data points in this graph in a curve that starts at about (-100, -10), rises sharply until about (-2.5, 0), and is parallel to the x axis until about (0.5, 0) and rises sharply again until about (10, 100). The loess curve intersects the linear fit line at three points, including at (0,0).\"\nfig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Homoscedasticity {#sec-chap08-homoscedasticity}\n\nAnother assumption is the equal distribution of points around the line, which is often called the assumption of <a class='glossary' title='Homoscedasticity is [homogeneity of variances], contrast is [Heteroscedasticity]. Homoscedasticity is an assumption of correlation and linear regression that requires that the variance of y be constant across all the values of x; visually, this assumption would show points along a fit line between x and y being evenly spread on either side of the line for the full range of the relationship.

The standard deviation is the square root of its variance. A useful property of the standard deviation is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same unit as the data. Standard deviation may be abbreviated SD, and is most commonly represented in mathematical texts and equations by the lower case Greek letter $\\sigma$ (sigma), for the population standard deviation, or the Latin letter $s$ for the sample standard deviation. ([Wikipedia] </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Standardization </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> In statistics, standardization (also called Normalizing) is the process of putting different variables on the same scale. This process allows you to compare scores between different types of variables. Typically, to standardize variables, you calculate the mean and standard deviation for a variable. Then, for each observed value of the variable, you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.

It’s very similar to a Z-score and you use it in the same way: find a cut off point, find your t score, and compare the two. You use the t statistic when you have a small sample size, or if you don’t know the population standard deviation.

But more technically it’s a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is.
