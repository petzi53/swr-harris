[Quarto callout blocks](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html): These are five standard small callout boxes: Note, Tip, Important, Caution, and Warning. In contrast to the other two typespf callout boxes there are no menu tabs inside these boxes.\n2. [Theorems](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs): These boxes are the commonly used theorems in articles and books in mathematics. There are ten theorem variations supported, each with their own label prefix: Theorem, Lemma, Corollary, Proposition, Conjecture, Definition, Example, Exercise, Solution, and Remark. I have changed most of these labels to highlight certain text types of my personal notes. Some of the theorems variation are used (partly with different name / label) as a collection of related R code chunks.\n3. [Custom boxes](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references-custom.html): As I needed more text types I have added several custom boxes. In contrast to the theorems and callout blocks is the numbering and title not in header but in an extra line above or under the box.\n4. [Special cases](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#overview): Figures, Tables and Listings have special treatments. They are used inside R code chunks, have special  and have routines in {{< latex >}} to [generate listings](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#lists). You can also generate dynamic captions and labels. Unfortunately there is still a glitch in Quarto version 1.4.549 with `#lst-` for code listing: If you are using it inside the code chunk then the code is always visible, e.g., your `code-fold: true` argument does not work. I have therefore used the listings --- similar as custom boxes --- with the header as an extra top line.\n5. [Citations](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html): I am using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to organize my citations and have all references collected into the `references.bib` file. \n\n## Quarto callout boxes\n\nI have used the following [Quarto callout blocks](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html):\n\n### Callout Note\n\n::: {.callout-note #nte-annex-b style=\"color: blue;\"}\n### Differences between book and my notes {.unnumbered}\n\nI am using this box to specify and rationalize my code changes with respect to the book’s code patterns.\n\nFor more theoretical or personal thoughts I have used the theorem variation \"Remark.\"\n\nThere is a second usage of callout note without numbering: In this case it highlights the wording for the null and alternate hypotheses with the title \"Wording for H0 and HA\".\n:::\n\n### Callout Tip\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip #tip-annex-b style=\"color: darkgreen;\"}\n### Until now (chapter 9, 2023-04-11) not used in this book {.unnumbered}\n\nSo far I haven't used the \"Tip\" callout box with numbering. As I have provided many theorems with different names I haven’t needed the tip box so far. Most of the tips are links collected under the theorem variation \"Lemma\" with the label \"Resource\". Sometimes I have written essential reminders for my learning activities into the \"Important\" box.\n\nIn the future, I will use it as a reminder for my own learning. It could contain also some links, but this box is not a link collection as the `resource` callout, but an argumentation and description what to learn.\n\nBut I have used this box without numbering with the label \"Report\". Under this heading I have summarized the analysis of data, mostly taken the text from the book. Sometimes I had to refer to another \"Report\" box to compare some wording. In this case I have added the custom box `#rep-` with the label \"Report\". \n:::\n\n### Callout Caution\n\n::: {.callout-caution #cau-annex-b style=\"color: darkgoldenrod;\"}\n### When to use the caution box? {.unnumbered}\n\n> Caution is typically used to indicate a potential hazard that may cause minor injuries or damage if not taken seriously. It serves as a reminder to be careful and exercise caution in order to prevent accidents. ([Caution versus Warning](https://thisvsthat.io/caution-vs-warning))\n\nIn the context of this book I am using the caution box to draw attention to something. If you don't mind it will result in more complex work, results or other issues one should prevent. If you don't pay attention to the caution box then the chances for errors will grow.\n\nSo far I haven’t applied this callout box. But I have used very heavily the custom unnumbered box \"Watch Out\" (35x) with the same --- resp. similar --- purpose. I am planning to transfer these paragraphs to a numbered alternative either as custom box or as a caution callout box.\n:::\n\n\n### Callout Warning\n\n::: {.callout-warning #wrn-annex-b style=\"color: darkorange;\"}\n### When to use the warning box? {.unnumbered}\n\n> Warning is used to indicate a more serious and immediate danger that could result in severe injuries or even death if not heeded. It implies a higher level of urgency and demands immediate attention and action to avoid potential harm. ([Caution versus Warning](https://thisvsthat.io/caution-vs-warning))\n\nIn the context of this book I am using the warning box to prevent a mistake, a wrong procedure. If you don't mind it will result in an error or other glitch that will lead to  wrong results. If you don't pay attention to the warning blunder will occur.\n\nSo far I have used this callout box only 3 times. I have to check if these applications conforms with the purpose of the box.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Callout Important\n\n::: {.callout-important #imp-annex-b style=\"color: red;\"}\n### Essential statements and take home messages {.unnumbered}\n\nThis box indicates crucial points, very often reminder to me to observe something or to learn something in greater detail or more thoroughly.\n\nSo far I haven't used this callout box, instead,I have applied an unnumbered custom box alternative 22 times. Again I am planning an transfer to a numbered alternative, possibly to this callout box.\n:::\n\n\n### Summary\n\n|  Callout  |   Code  | CSS-style                     | Code Purpose / without Code       |\n|:---------:|:-------:|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|    Note   | `#nte-` | [style=\"color: blue;\" ]{.nte} | Book differences / H0-HA          |\n|    Tip    | `#tip-` | [style=\"color: darkgreen;\"]{.tip}   | Learning reminder / Report  |\n|  Caution  | `#cau-` | [style=\"color: darkgoldenrod;\"]{.cau} | Pay attention             |\n|  Warning  | `#wrn-` | [style=\"color: darkorange;\"]{.wrn}    | Prevent mistake           |\n| Important | `#imp-` | [style=\"color: red;\"]{.imp}. | Crucial observations, definitions  |\n: Purpose and appearances of callout boxes {#tbl-purpose-callout}\n\n\n## Theorems and variations\n\nAll `theorem` boxes are provided in two forms: numbered and unnumbered.  They use the provided cross-reference code for numbering but their names are often changed for my purposes.\n\nIn the following collection I have provided the header with the following seqeunce:\n\n- original name of `theorem` variant\n- name in the output in parenthesis\n- cross reference code\n\n\"Solution\" and \"Remark\" are somewhat different as the other Theorems variants: They have a cursive header name.\n\n### Conjecture (R Code) `#cnj-`\n\n:::::{.my-r-code}\n:::{.my-r-code-header}\n:::::: {#cnj-ID-text}\n: Numbered R Code Title\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-r-code-container}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n:::::\n\n\n### Corollary (Assessment) `#cor-`\n\n:::::{.my-assessment}\n:::{.my-assessment-header}\n:::::: {#cor-assess}\n: Numbered Assessment Title\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-assessment-container}\nHere include  assessment text\n::::\n:::::\n\n\n### Definition (Experiment) `#def-`\n\n:::::{.my-experiment}\n:::{.my-experiment-header}\n:::::: {#def-experiment-text}\n: Numbered Experiment Title\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-experiment-container}\nHere include text for experiment\n::::\n:::::\n\n### Example \n\n:::::{.my-example}\n:::{.my-example-header}\n:::::: {#exm-ID-text}\n: Numbered Example Title\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-example-container}\nHere include example text\n::::\n:::::\n\n### Exercise\n\n:::::{.my-exercise}\n:::{.my-exercise-header}\n:::::: {#exr-ID-text}\n: Numbered Exercise Title\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-exercise-container}\nHere include exercise text\n::::\n:::::\n\n\n\n### Lemma\n\n:::::{.my-resource}\n:::{.my-resource-header}\n:::::: {#lem-resource-text}\n: Numbered Resource Title\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-resource-container}\nHere include text for the resource\n::::\n:::::\n\n\n\n\n### Proposition \n\n:::::{.my-procedure}\n:::{.my-procedure-header}\n:::::: {#prp-ID-text}\n: Numbered Procedure Title\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-procedure-container}\nHere include procedure text\n::::\n:::::\n\n### Remark\n\n:::::{.my-remark}\n:::{.my-remark-header}\n:::::: {#rem-remark}\n: Numbered Remark Title\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-remark-container}\nHere include remark text\n::::\n:::::\n\n\n### Solution\n\n:::::{.my-solution}\n:::{.my-solution-header}\n:::::: {#sol-solution-text}\n: Numbered Solution Title\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-solution-container}\nHere include text for the solution\n::::\n:::::\n\n\n\n### Theorem\n\n:::::{.my-theorem}\n:::{.my-theorem-header}\n:::::: {#thm-theorem-text}\n: Numbered Theorem Title\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-theorem-container}\n$$\nHere include text for the theorem\n$$ {#eq-chapXY-formula}\n::::\n:::::\n\n\n\n## Custom boxes\n\n:::::{.my-package}\n:::{.my-package-header}\nPackage Name\n:::\n::::{.my-package-container}\nHere include package description\n::::\n:::::\n\n\n:::::{.my-checklist}\n:::{.my-checklist-header}\nTODO\n:::\n::::{.my-checklist-container}\nHere include checklist text\n::::\n:::::\n\n\n\n::: {#sol-line}\n\n## Line\n\nThe equation of any straight line, called a linear equation, can be written as:\n\n$$\ny = mx + b\n$$\n:::\n\nSee @sol-line.\n",
