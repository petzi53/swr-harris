These chapters also contains experiments and additional self-created exercises. \n- Currently I have started working on chapter 6.\n:::\n\n::: my-watch-out\n::: my-watch-out-header\nWATCH OUT: This is my personal learning material and is therefore\nneither an accurate replication nor an authoritative textbook.\n:::\n\n::: my-watch-out-container\nI am writing this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to\nbecome explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more carefully.\nPlease keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a\nlearner.\n\nText passages with content I am already familiar I have skipped. Section\nof the original text where I needed more in-depth knowledge I have\nelaborated and added my own comments resulted from my personal research.\n\nBe warned! In spite of replicating most of the content this Quarto book\nmay contain many mistakes. All the misapprehensions and errors are of\ncourse my own responsibility.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Content and Goals of this Book {.unnumbered}\n\nThis Quarto book collects my personal notes, trials and exercises of\n[Statistics With R: Solving Problems Using Real-World\nData](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/statistics-with-r/book253567) by\nJenine K. Harris [@harris2020].\n\nThis introductory textbook for Statistics with R has three outstanding\nfeatures:\n\n### Data Wrangling\n\nThe book applies real data sets with all their problems: missing data,\ninconsistent structure, not appropriate data types, not understandable\nlabels, accompanying extensive code books etc. Data management is\ntherefore a major part of the book, a subject often not taught. Many\nintroductory textbooks work with already cleaned data and miss the\nnecessity to guide students to bring messy data into an analyzable form.\n\n### Inclusion\n\nThe author aims to support women and other underrepresented groups to\npursue a data science career. By choosing a narrative style with three\nprototypical feminine characters the book discusses the approaches not\nonly in details but also shows the effect of not optimal coding\nsolutions. The solutions are developed step by step and each improvement\nreplicates the code already written. These repetitions helps not only to\ncompare the differences but shows that code has to be developed bit by\nbit, tested, improved, and tested again. Another interesting practice\nshown in the book is to try different approaches to the same problem and\nthe re-usability of already written code. All these practices help to\nlower barriers and to facilitate learning statistics with R.\n\n### Compelling social science topics\n\nThe three characters (Leslie a statistics student, who wants to learn R;\nNancy an experienced data scientist and coding specialist; Kiara a data\nmanagement guru worried especially about reproducibility) discuss\nreal-world problem analysis from different angles. Every chapter starts\nwith a short introduction about the background of the social problem the\ntext is going to analyze. By introducing using publicly available data\nsources that have to be modified and cleaned one learns very important\ntransferable skills. After working through the book it should be easy to\nwork on his/her own research questions using public data sets.\n\n## Text passages\n\n### Quotes and personal comments\n\nMy text consists mostly of quotes from the first edition of Harris’\nbook. I converted my kindle book into a PDF file which I copied via the\nannotation system in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) into my Quarto\nfiles.\n\n::: my-example\n::: my-example-header\n::: {#exm-preface-quote}\n: Quote\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-example-container\n> “NA is a reserved “word” in R. In order to use NA, both letters must\n> be uppercase (Na or na does not work), and there can be no quotation\n> marks (R will treat “NA” as a character rather than a true missing\n> value)” ([Harris, 2020, p.\n> 121](zotero://select/groups/5254842/items/9N29QMJB))\n> ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5254842/items/3NDRGBBW?page=121&annotation=XBYU53LG))\n:::\n:::\n\n@exm-preface-quote has links to my PDF and also to my annotation of the\nPDF. These links are a practical way for me to get the context of the\nquote. But as the linked PDF is saved locally at my hard disk these\nlinks do not work for you! (There is an option about [Zotero\ngroups](https://www.zotero.org/groups) to share files, but the PDF is\nnot free to use and so I can't offer this possibility.)\n\nOften I made minor editing (e.g., shorting the text) or put the content\nin my own wording. In this case I couldn't quote the text as it does not\nrepresent a specific annotation in my Zotero file. In this case I ended\nthe paraphrase with `(Harris ibid.)`.\n\nIn any case most of the text in this Quarto book is not mine but coming\nfrom different resources (Harris’ book, R help files, websites). Most of\nthe time I have put my own personal notes into a notes box as shown in\n@exm-preface-note.\n\n::: my-example\n::: my-example-header\n::: {#exm-preface-note}\n: Personal note\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-example-container\n::: my-note\n::: my-note-header\n::: {#cor-preface-note-example}\n: This is a personal note\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-note-container\nIn this kind of box I will write my personal thoughts and reflections.\nUsually this box will appear stand-alone (without the wrapping example\nbox).\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n### Glossary\n\nI am using the {**glossary**} package to create links to glossary\nentries.\\]\n\n::: my-r-code\n::: my-r-code-header\n::: {#cnj-load-glossary}\n: Load glossary\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-r-code-container\n::: {#lst-preview-load-glossary}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## 1.

But more technically it’s a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is. (StatisticsHowTo)'>Z-Score</a>.\n\n::: my-watch-out\n::: my-watch-out-header\nWATCH OUT! Glossary text not authorized by the author of SWR\n:::\n\n::: my-watch-out-container\n::: {layout=\"[10, 30]\" layout-valign=\"center\"}\n![](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/logo.png)\n\nI have added many of the glossary entries when I was working through\nother books either taking the text passage of these books I was reading\nor via an internet recherche from other resources. I have added the\nsource of glossary entry. Sometimes I have used abbreviation, but I need\nstill to provide a key what this short references mean.\n:::\n\nJenine Harris has collected her own glossary. Where ever it is suitable\nfor my learning path I have added her entries into my dictionary. To\napply the glossary into this text I have used the {**glossary**} package\nby [Lisa DeBruine](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/index.html).\n:::\n:::\n\nIf you fork the [repository of this quarto\nbook](https://github.com/petzi53/swr-harris) then the glossary will not\nwork out of the box. Load down the `glossary.yml` file from [my\nglossary-pb GitHub\nrepo](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml),\nstore it on your hard disk and change the path in the code chunk\n@lst-preview-load-glossary.\n\nIn any case I am the only responsible person for this text, especially\nif I have used code from the resources wrongly or misunderstood a quoted\ntext passage.\n\n## R Code and Datasets\n\nHarris provides R code and datasets via her [Github\nsite](https://github.com/jenineharris/statistics-in-R-data-sets) but you\ncan also download these files directly from the [Student\nResources](https://edge.sagepub.com/harris1e/student-resources/datasets-and-r-code)\nof the publisher's SAGE website.\n\nHarris introduces and uses in the book [Google’s R Style\nGuide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html) with camelCase.\nThe reference is pointing to a fork of the [Tidyverse Style\nGuide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). I am going to use underscore (`_`)\nor [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) to replace\nspaces as studies has shown that it is easier to read [@sharif2010]. But\nI will use the other Google modifications from the tidyverse style\nguide:\n\n-   Start the names of private functions with a dot.\n-   Don't use `base::attach()`.\n-   No right-hand assignments.\n-   Use explicit returns.\n-   Qualify namespace.\n\nEspecially the last point (qualifying namespace) is important for my\nlearning. Besides preventing conflicts with functions of identical names\nfrom different packages it helps to learn (or remember) which function\nbelongs to which package. I think this justifies the small overhead and\nhelps to make R code chunks self-sufficient. (No previous package\nloading, or library calls in the setup chunk.) To foster learning the\nrelation between function and package I embrace the package name with\ncurly brakes and format it in bold.\n\nI am using the package name also for the default installation of base R.\nThis wouldn't be necessary but it helps me to understand where the base\nR functions come from. What follows is a list of base R packages of the\nsystem library included into every installation and attached (opened) by\ndefault:\n\n-   {**base**}: The R Base Package\n-   {**datsets**}: The R Datasets Package\n-   {**graphics**}: The R Graphics Package\n-   {**grDevices**}: The R Graphics Devices and Support for Colours and\n    Fonts\n-   {**methods**}: Formal Methods and Classes\n-   {**stats**}: The R Stats Package\n-   {**utils**}: The R Utils Package\n\nI am not using always the exact code snippets for my replications\nbecause I am not only replicating the code to see how it works but also\nto change the values of parameters to observe their influences.\n\nIn \"Statistics with R\" there are all names of function arguments\nexplicitly mentioned. This is also the case for function with just one\nargument, for instance\n`base::summary(object = <r object to summarize>)`. When it is clear then\nI will follow the advice from Hadley Wickham:\n\n> When you call a function, you typically omit the names of data\n> arguments, because they are used so commonly. If you override the\n> default value of an argument, use the full name ([tidyverse style\n> guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html)).\n\nFor educational reasons Harris develops code step by step and replicates\nthe complete code including the previous — already explained — snippets.\nIn these cases I use tabs as an organizing structure so that one can see\n(and compare) the piecemeal development.\n\n## Resources\n\n::: my-resource\n::: my-resource-header\nResources used for this Quarto book\n:::\n\n::: my-resource-container\n-   [Statistics With\n    R](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/statistics-with-r/book253567):\n    Website\n-   [R Code](https://edge.sagepub.com/system/files/r_code_1.zip):\n    Download\n-   [Datasets](https://edge.sagepub.com/system/files/datasets_7.zip):\n    Download\n:::\n:::\n\n## Packages introduced in the preface\n\n:::::{.my-resource}\n:::{.my-resource-header}\nglossary: Glossaries for Markdown and Quarto Documents\n:::\n::::{.my-resource-container}\n\n***\n\n::: {#pak-glossary}\n\n***\n\n{**glossary**}: [Glossaries for Markdown and Quarto Documents](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/)\n\nAdd glossaries to markdown and quarto documents by tagging individual words.

The goal of glossary is to provide a lightweight solution for making glossaries in educational materials written in quarto or R Markdown. This package provides functions to link terms in text to their definitions in an external glossary file, as well as create a glossary table of all linked terms at the end of a section.\n\n:::\n\n\n{**glossary**}: A Package to Create Glossaries for Markdown and Quarto Documents\n:::\n\n\n***\n::::\n:::::\n\n## Glossary\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> definition </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Z-score </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A z-score (also called a standard score) gives you an idea of how far from the mean a data point is.
