## Gun violence in the US

1.  Research about gun violence in under developed. Harris refers to an
    article by Stark & Shah [-@stark2017] (Figure 1 and 2).

2.  Data for figure 3 (Homicides in the US by guns 2012-2016) comes from
    the [Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)](fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr):

    > The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program generates reliable
    > statistics for use in law enforcement. It also provides
    > information for students of criminal justice, researchers, the
    > media, and the public. The program has been providing crime
    > statistics since 1930.

    > The UCR Program includes data from more than 18,000 city,
    > university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law
    > enforcement agencies. Agencies participate voluntarily and submit
    > their crime data either through a state UCR program or directly to
    > the FBI's UCR Program.

3.  Figure 4: Handguns were the most widely used type of gun for
    homicide in 2016.

4.  Gun manufacturers play an essential role: Figure 5 and 6.

### Data, codebook, and R packages

::: my-resource
::: my-resource-header
Data, codebook, and R packages for data visualization
:::

::: my-resource-container
**Data**

There are two options:

1.  Download the three data files from
    <https://edge.sagepub.com/harris1e>
    -   nhanes_2011_2012_ch3.csv
    -   fbi_deaths_2016_ch3.csv
    -   gun_publications_funds_2004_2015_ch3.csv
2.  Download
    -   the raw data directly from the Internet for the FBI deaths data
    -   the `r glossary("NHANES")` data by following the instructions in
        Box 3.1
    -   the gun_publications_funds_2004_2015_ch3.csv from
        <https://edge.sagepub.com/harris1e>

I will only work with the second option.

**Codebook**

Again there are two options:

1.  Download from <https://edge.sagepub.com/harris1e>
    -   nhanes_demographics_2012_codebook.html
    -   nhanes_auditory_2012_codebook.html
2.  Access the codebooks online on the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey [(NHANES)
    website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2011)

I will only work with the second option.

**Packages**

1.  Packages used with the book (sorted alphabetically)

-   {**data.table**}: @pak-data-table (Tyson Barrett)
-   {**ggmosaic**}: @pak-ggmosaic (Haley Jeppson)
-   {**ggrepel**}: @pak-ggrepel (Kamil Slowikowski)

-   {**scales**}: @pak-scales (Hadley Wickham)
-   {**tidyverse**}: @pak-tidyverse (Hadley Wickham)
-   {**waffle**}: @pak-waffle (Bob Rudis)

::: my-watch-out
::: my-watch-out-header
WATCH OUT! Instead of downloading the file with {**httr**} I will use
`utils::download.file()`
:::

::: my-watch-out-container
Harris lists the older {**httr**} package, but now there is {**httr2**},
"a modern re-imagining of {**httr**} that uses a pipe-based interface
and solves more of the problems that `r glossary("API")` wrapping
packages face." (See @pak-httr2)

In the book is the {**httr**} package just used for downloading the
excel file from the FBI website. For this specific task there is no need
to download, install and learn a new package. You can use
`utils::download.file()`, a function as I have it already applied
successfully in @lst-chap02-get-brfss-2014-data.

2.  My additional packages (sorted alphabetically)

-   {**cowplot**}: @pak-cowplot (Claus O. Wilke)
-   {**ggtext**}: @pak-ggtext (Claus O. Wilke)

### Get data

The data can be download from the internet with the following URL:
<https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-4.xls/output.xls>

To get the data for this chapter is a three step procedure:

::: my-procedure
::: my-procedure-header
::: {#prp-chap03-get-internet-data}
: How to get data from the internet
:::
:::

::: my-procedure-container
1.  My first step is always to go to the website and download the file
    manually. Some people may believe that this is superfluous, but I
    think there are three advantages for this preparatory task:
    -   Inspecting the website and checking if the URL is valid and
        points to the correct dataset.
    -   Checking the file extension
    -   Inspecting the file after downloaded to see if there is
        something to care about (e.g., the file starts with several
        lines, that are not data, or other issues).
2.  Download the file using `utils::donwload.file()`.
3.  Read the imported file into R with the appropriate program function,
    in the first case `readxl::read_excel()`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In changed the recommended R code by Harris for downloading the FBI
Excel Data I in several ways:

1.  I did not use command from {**httr**}, but `utils::download.file()`.
2.  Instead creating a data frame with `base::data.frame()` I used a
    `tibble::tibble()`. This has the advantage that the column names
    were not changed. In the original files the column names are years,
    but in base R is not allowed that column names start with a number.
    In tidyverse this is possible but you must refer to this column
    names with enclosed accents like `2016`.
3.  Instead of saving the data as an Excel file I think that it is more
    convenient to store it as an R object with the extension ".rds". (I
    believe that Harris saved it in the book only to get the same
    starting condition with the already downloaded file in the books
    companion web site.)

{RNHANES} combines as a package specialized to download data from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) step 2 and 3
of @prp-chap03-get-internet-data. But as it turned out it only doesn't
work with newer audiology data than 2012. I tried to use the package
with data from 2016 and 2018 (For 2014 there are no audiology data
available), but I got an error message.

> Error in validate_year(year) : Invalid year: 2017-2018

The problem lies in the function `RNHANES:::validate_year()`. It
qualifies in version 1.1.0 only downloads until '2013-2014' as valid:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```         
function (year, throw_error = TRUE) 
{
    if (length(year) > 1) {
        Map(validate_year, year, throw_error = throw_error) %>% 
            unlist() %>% unname() %>% return()
    }
    else {
        valid <- switch(as.character(year), `1999-2000` = TRUE, 
            `2001-2002` = TRUE, `2003-2004` = TRUE, `2005-2006` = TRUE, 
            `2007-2008` = TRUE, `2009-2010` = TRUE, `2011-2012` = TRUE, 
            `2013-2014` = TRUE, FALSE)
        if (throw_error == TRUE && valid == FALSE) {
            stop(paste0("Invalid year: ", year))
        }
        return(valid)
    }
}
```

**Conclusion**: Special data packages can facilitate your work, but to
know how to download data programmatically on your own is an
indispensable data science skill.

See tab "NHANES 2018" how this is done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For recoding the levels of the categorical variable I have looked up the
appropriate passage in the codebook (see:
@fig-firearms-use-codebook-2012).

With the last line `dplyr::relocate(gun_use)` I put the column `gun_use`
to the front of the data frame. If neither the `.before` nor the
`.after` argument of the function are supplied the column will move
columns to the left-hand side of the data frame. So it is easy to find
for visual inspections via the RStudio data frame viewer.

::: my-note
::: my-note-header
When to remove the NA's?
:::

::: my-note-container
It would be not correct to remove the NA's here in the recoding code
chunk, because this would remove the rows with missing values from the
`gun_use` variable across the whole data frame! This implies that values
of other variable that are not missing would be removed too. It is
correct to remove the NA's when the output for the analysis (graph or
table) is prepared via the pipe operator without changing the stored
data.

I got a warning about a unknown level `7` because no respondent refused
an answer. But this is not important. I could either choose to not
recode level `7` or turn warning off in the chunk option --- or simply
to ignore the warning.

### Classification of Graphs

#### Introduction

There are different possible classification of graph types. In the book
Harris uses as major criteria the types and numbers of variables. This
is very sensitive subject orientated arrangement addressed at the
statistics novice with the main question: What type of graph should I
use for my data?

The disadvantage of the subject oriented selection criteria is that
there some graph types (e.g. the bar chart) that appear several times
under different headings. Explaining the graph types is therefore
somewhat redundant on the one hand and piecemeal on the other hand.

Another classification criteria would be the type of the graph itself.
Under this pattern one could concentrate of the special features for
each graph type. One of these features would be their applicability
referring the variable types.

Book variable types and their corresponding graph types
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can see the redundancy when you categorize the graph types by
variable types. But the advantage is, that your choice of graph is
driven by essential statistical aspects.

This chapter will follow the book and therefore it will present the same
order in the explication of the graphs as in the book outlined.

###### Graphs

::: {#bul-chap03-graph-types}
-   Bar chart
-   Box plot
-   Density plot
-   Histogram
-   Line plot
-   Mosaic plot
-   Pie chart
-   Point chart
-   Scatterplot

Book graph types sorted alphabetically
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very abridged list of graphs used for presentation of
statistical results. Although it is just a tiny selection of possible
graphs it contains those graphs that are most important, most used and
most well know types.

Categorization of graph types used by [R Chart](https://r-charts.com/)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although this list has only 8 categories it is in contrast to
@bul-chap03-graph-types a more complete list of different graphs. It
features also not so well known graph types. Besides a miscellaneous
category where the members of this group do not share a common feature
the graph are sorted in categorization schema that has --- with the
exception of bar charts --- no redundancy, e.g. is almost a taxonomy of
graph types.

This is the same variable oriented approach as in the book but with much
more details and differentiation. It is cluttered with redundancies but
should be helpful for selecting an appropriate graph type for your data
analysis. And the interactive style on the web allows for a much better
orientation as implemented in the above list.

#| cache: true


## bar chart: bars with wide width
p_normal <- gun_use_2012 |> 
    tidyr::drop_na() |>     
    ggplot2::ggplot(
        ggplot2::aes(x = gun_use)
    ) +
    ggplot2::geom_bar() + 
    ggplot2::labs(x = "Gun use", 
                  y = "Number of participants") +
    ggplot2::theme_minimal()

## bar chart: bars with small width
p_small <- gun_use_2012 |> 
    tidyr::drop_na() |>
    ggplot2::ggplot(
        ggplot2::aes(x = gun_use)
    ) +
    ggplot2::geom_bar(width = 0.4) + 
    ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
    ggplot2::theme(aspect.ratio = 4/1) +
    ggplot2::labs(x = "Gun use", 
                  y = "Number of participants")

## display both charts side by side
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p_normal, p_small, ncol = 2)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Left**: Only two bars look horrifying. In this example they are
    even a lot smaller as normal, because of the second graph to the
    right.
2.  **Right**: It is not enough to create smaller bars with the `width`
    argument inside the `ggplot2::geom_bar()` function because that
    would create unproportional wide space between the two bars. One
    need to apply the aspect ratio for the used theme as well. In this
    case all commands to the theme (e.g. my `ggplot2::the_bw()`) has to
    come before the `aspect.ratio` argument. One has to try out which
    aspect ratio works best.
3.  I used here --- as recommended in the book --- the {**gridExtra**}
    package to display the figures side by side (see @pak-gridExtra).
    But there are other options as well. In the next tab I will use the
    {**patchwork**} package, that is especially for {**ggplot2**}
    developed (see @pak-patchwork). A third option would be to use one
    of Quarto formatting commands: See
    -   [Subfigures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#subfigures)
    -   [Figure
        panels](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#figure-panels)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Left**: This graph has the color fill argument within `aes()` and
    is therefore data controlled. This means that the colors will be
    settled automatically by factor level.
-   **Middle left**: This graph has the color fill argument outside
    `aes()` and is therefore manually controlled. One needs to supply
    colors otherwise one gets a graph without any colors at all.
-   **Middle right**: Even if the graph has the color fill argument
    within `aes()` and is therefore data controlled, you can change the
    color composition. But you has also the responsibility to provide a
    correct legend --- or as I have done in this example --- to remove
    the legend from the display. (The argument `guide = FALSE` as used
    in the book is superseded with `guide = "none"`)
-   **Right**: The graph is manually controlled because it has the color
    fill argument outside `aes()` with specified colors.

I used {**patchwork**} here to show all four example graphs side by side
(see @pak-patchwork). I needed some time and had to experiment because
at first I tried it with the `+` operator. But that produced two very
small graphs in the first row of the middle of the display area, and
other two small graphs in the second row of the middle of the display
area. Beside this ugly display the text of the subtitle was also
truncated.

### Pie Chart {#sec-chap03-pie-chart}

`r glossary("Pie charts")` show parts of a whole. The pie, or circle,
represents the whole. The slices of pie shown in different colors
represent the parts. A similar graph type is the but they are **not
recommended"** for several reasons

-   Humans aren’t particularly good at estimating quantity from angles:
    Once we have more than two categories, pie charts can easily
    misrepresent percentages and become hard to read.
-   Pie charts do badly when there are lots of categories: Matching the
    labels and the slices can be hard work and small percentages (which
    might be important) are tricky to show.

BTW: Donut charts are even worse than pie charts:

2.  **Use a very limited number of wedges (best not more than two) for
    making a clear point.**

The most important code line to create a pie graph is
`ggplot2::coord_polar(theta = 'y')`. In the concept of `gg` (grammar of
graphics) a car chart and a pie chart are --- with the exception of the
above code line --- identical [@c2010].

Beside the `ggplot2::annotate()` function for text comments inside
graphics I had for to get the necessary formatting options for the big
number also to use {**ggtext**}, one of [132 registered {**ggplot2**}
extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/). {**ggtext**}
enables the rendering of complex formatted plot labels (see
@pak-ggtext).

Graph options for a single continuous variable
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Histograms and density plots** are very similar to each other and
    show the overall shape of the data. These two types of graphs are
    especially useful in determining whether or not a variable has a
    normal distribution.

-   **Boxplots** show the central tendency and spread of the data, which
    is another way to determine whether a variable is normally
    distributed or skewed.

-   **Violin plots** are also useful when looking at a continuous
    variable and are like a combination of boxplots and density plots.
    Violin plots are commonly used to examine the distribution of a
    continuous variable for different levels (or groups) of a factor (or
    categorical) variable.

With histograms it is important to play around with the number of
`bins`. This changes the appearance of histograms sometimes quite
profoundly. The default of 30 bins displays a warning that one should
choose a better value with the argument `binwidth` (another option to
control the number of bins.)

It is not quite clear for me what would be the optimal number of bins of
a given data set. It was easy for @fig-histogram-physical-health: There
were only 30 different values, each for one. So to provide the same
number of bins as number of observed days (= 30) was a sensible choice.

There is not much difference in the case of 10 or 30 bins of
@def-chap03-histogram-research-funding. A big difference would be for
example when the number of modes is changing, or the mode is moving far
to another value. It seems to me that with a density plot it is simpler
to choose the optimal curve (even if I do not understand the underlying
rationale of this `r glossary("kernel density estimation")` (KDE)
procedure).

This is the density plot without changing the default bandwidth. It uses
`nrd0` as bandwidth. One can see that it is somewhat similar to
`bw = 1.5` (see @fig-density-plot-research-funding-2).

-   `bw.nrd0` implements a rule-of-thumb for choosing the bandwidth of a
    Gaussian kernel density estimator. It defaults to 0.9 times the
    minimum of the standard deviation and the interquartile range
    divided by 1.34 times the sample size to the negative one-fifth
    power (= Silverman's ‘rule of thumb’, Silverman (1986, page 48, eqn
    (3.31))) unless the quartiles coincide when a positive result will
    be guaranteed. (Quoted form the help file of `stats::bandwidth()`)

The equivalent of `binwidth` in histograms is `bw` (smoothing bandwidth)
in density plots. I have to confess that I do not understand all the
relevant factors to choose the optimal bandwidth for density plots (or
binwidth for histograms).

In density plots there is also the `kernel` argument for choosing the
appropriate smoothing kernel. I learned from the video by od webel
[-@webelod2018] that the chosen kernel (gaussian", the standard,
"rectangular", "triangular", "epanechnikov", "biweight", "cosine" or
"optcosine") is not so important because the result all in similar
distributions. Most important, however, is to choose the appropriate
bandwidth.

It is said that one disadvantage of density plots is its feature to
smooth out the distribution so that you cannot see anymore --- in
contrast to histograms --- if there are gaps in the data. But if you
choose a very small bandwidth like `ucv` then you get a distribution
similar to a histogram.

::: my-resource
::: my-resource-header
Information about kernel density estimation and bandwidth
:::

::: my-resource-container
Much of my understanding about bandwidth and kernel density estimation
comes from the video [Intro to Kernel Density
Estimation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5zLaWT5KPs) by od webel
[-@webelod2018].

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5zLaWT5KPs >}}

Another article on this complex topic: [What is Kernel Density
Estimation?](https://www.statisticshowto.com/kernel-density-estimation/).
From this article I learned that a kernel is nothing else as a weighting
function to estimate the `r glossary("probability density function")`
(PDF). (Until now I had a sketchy impression about this concept derived
from another meaning of "kernel", related with the core part of a
computer.)

### Box Plot {#sec-chap03-box-plot-1}

`r glossary("Histograms")` and `r glossary("density plots")` are great
for examining the overall shape of the data for a continuous variable.
`r glossary("Boxplots")` in contrasts are useful for identifying the
middle value and the boundaries around the middle half of the data.

## Achievement 3: Graph for two variable at once {#sec-chap03-achievement-3}

### Two categorical variables

#### Mosaic Plot {#sec-chap03-mosaic-plot}

`r glossary("Mosaic plots")` also called
[Marimekko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marimekko) charts or Mekko
charts show the relative size of groups across two or more variables. It
gives an overview of the data and makes it possible to recognize
relationships between different variables. For example, independence is
shown when the boxes across categories all have the same areas.

Mosaic plots are the multidimensional extension of
[spineplots](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/spineplot.html),
which graphically display the same information for only one variable.

::: {#bul-chap03-mosaic-charts-properties}
-   The displayed variables are categorical or ordinal scales.
-   The plot is of at least two variables. There is no upper limit, but
    too many variables may be confusing in graphic form.
-   The number of observations is not limited, but not read in the
    image.
-   The areas of the rectangular tiles that are available for a
    combination of features are proportional to the number of
    observations that have this combination of features.
-   Unlike as other graphs, it is not possible for the mosaic plot to
    plot a confidence interval.

Better use of mosaic charts when variables have different levels with different proportions
:::
::::{.my-note-container}
@fig-mosaic-gun-use-sex is a bad example for a mosaic chart: One of its features (that the area of the columns reflect the proportion of the level) does not shine in this example because both levels (men and women) have approximately the same proportion (49.8 vs. 50.2%). Although it is better to have variables with several levels.

WATCH OUT! Loading and attaching {**ggmosaic**} is mandatory

Just calling the {**ggmosaic**} functions with the `::` syntax results into an error. I have to expressively load and attach the package with `library(ggmosiac)`. But the error only appears when I render the whole document; running just the R code chunk
works. I suppose that this results from a misbehavior of the
{**ggmosaic**} code.

There is also another warning with {**ggmosaic**} version 0.33: One
should use `tidyr::unite(`) instead of `tidyr::unite_()` since
{**tidyr**} version 1.2.0. This is a missing adaption in the
{**ggmosaic**} package as the warning message pointed out. I could get
rid of this warning message by installing the GitHub version 0.34 as recommended in this [GitHub post](https://github.com/haleyjeppson/ggmosaic/issues/68#issuecomment-1812411397).

This is already a more informative chart as @fig-mosaic-gun-use-sex. It shows that women are not only less using a gun, those they do, they fire less round than men. 

But mosaic charts really shine when both variables have several levels as shown in @fig-mosaic-rounds-fired-ear-plugs.

The chart clearly shows that a part (more than 1/3 of the respondent) never use ear plugs, even if they fire many rounds.

The {**cowplot**} package provides various features that help with
creating publication-quality figures, such as a set of themes, functions
to align plots and arrange them into complex compound figures, and
functions that make it easy to annotate plots and or mix plots with
images. The package was originally written for internal use in the Wilke
lab, hence the name (Claus O. Wilke’s plot package). It has also been
used extensively in the book [Fundamentals of Data
Visualization](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492031089).
:::

There are several packages that can be used to align plots. The most
widely used ones beside {**cowplot**} are {**egg**} and {**patchwork**}
(see @pak-patchwork). All these packages use slightly different
approaches to plot alignment, and the respective approaches have
different strengths and weaknesses. If you cannot achieve your desired
result with one of these packages try another one.

Most importantly, while {**egg**} and {**patchwork**} align and arrange
plots at the same time, {**cowplot**} aligns plots independently of how
they are arranged. This makes it possible to align plots and then
reproduce them separately, or even overlay them on top of each other.

The {**cowplot**} package now provides a set of complementary themes
with different features. I now believe that there isn’t one single theme
that works for all figures, and therefore I recommend that you always
explicitly set a theme for every plot you make.

{**ggmosaic**} is designed to create visualizations of categorical data
and is capable of producing bar charts, stacked bar charts, mosaic
plots, and double decker plots and therefore offers a wide range of
potential plots.

Furthermore, {**ggmosaic**} allows various features to be customized:

-   the order of the variables,
-   the formula setup of the plot,
-   faceting,
-   the type of partition, and
-   the space between the categories.

The ggtext package provides simple Markdown and HTML rendering for
{**ggplot2.**} Under the hood, the package uses the {**gridtext**}
package for the actual rendering, and consequently it is limited to the
[feature set provided by gridtext](https://wilkelab.org/gridtext/).

Support is provided for Markdown both in theme elements (plot titles,
subtitles, captions, axis labels, legends, etc.) and in geoms (similar
to `ggplot2::geom_text()`). In both cases, there are two alternatives,
one for creating simple text labels and one for creating text boxes with
word wrapping.

Provides a number of user-level functions to work with "grid" graphics,
notably to arrange multiple grid-based plots on a page, and draw tables.

The {**grid**) package (= part of the R system library) provides
low-level functions to create graphical objects (`grobs`), and position
them on a page in specific viewports. The {**gtable**} package
introduced a higher-level layout scheme, arguably more amenable to
user-level interaction. With the `gridExtra::arrangeGrob()` /
`gridExtra::grid.arrange()` pair of functions, {**gridExtra**} builds
upon {**gtable**} to arrange multiple `grobs` on a page.

![](img/chap03/logoi/logo-janitor-min.png){width="176"}

{**janitor**} has simple functions for examining and cleaning dirty
data. It was built with beginning and intermediate R users in mind and
is optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users can perform many of
these tasks already, but with janitor they can do it faster and save
their thinking for the fun stuff.
:::

**The main janitor functions:**

-   perfectly format data.frame column names;
-   create and format frequency tables of one, two, or three variables -
    think an improved `base::table()`; and
-   provide other tools for cleaning and examining data.frames.

The tabulate-and-report functions approximate popular features of SPSS
and Microsoft Excel.

{**janitor**} is a {**tidyverse**}-oriented package. Specifically, it
plays nicely with the `%>%` pipe and is optimized for cleaning data
brought in with the {**readr**} and {**readxl**} packages.

{**janitor**}: A Package for Simple Tools for Examining and Cleaning

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am using {**janitor**} mostly in two ways:

1.  as better `base::table()` function, using `janitor::tabyl()`
    -   `base::table()` doesn't accept data.frames and is therefore not
        compatible with the pipe
    -   `base::table()` doesn't output data.frames
    -   `base::table()` results are hard to format (the most annoying
        "feature" for me)

-   to add information and formatting to the table with the
    `janitor::adorn_*` functions
    -   `janitor::adorn_totals()`
    -   `janitor::adorn_percentages()`
    -   `janitor::adorn_pct_formatting()`
    -   `janitor::adorn_rounding()`
    -   `janitor::adorn_ns()` (adding Ns = number of counts)
    -   `janitor::adorn_title()`

You could also use {**tidyverse**} commands (for instance for a two
table `dplyr::count()` followed by `tidyr::pivot_wider()`) but the many
`adorn_*`-functions make it easy to enhance the results. BTW: The prefix
`adorn` comes from 'adornment' (ornament, decoration).

::: {layout="[10, 30]" layout-valign="center"}
![](img/chap03/logoi/logo-patchwork-min.png){width="176"}

The goal of {**patchwork**} is to make it ridiculously simple to combine
separate `ggplots` into the same graphic. As such it tries to solve the
same problem as `gridExtra::grid.arrange()` and `cowplot::plot_grid` but
using an `r glossary("API")` that incites exploration and iteration, and
scales to arbitrarily complex layouts.
:::

The {**ggplot2**} package provides a strong API for sequentially
building up a plot, but does not concern itself with composition of
multiple plots. {**patchwork**} is a package that expands the API to
allow for arbitrarily complex composition of plots by, among others,
providing mathematical operators for combining multiple plots. Other
packages that try to address this need (but with a different approach)
are {**gridExtra**} and {**cowplot**} (see @pak-gridExtra and
@pak-cowplot).

Before plots can be laid out, they have to be assembled. Arguably one of
patchwork’s biggest selling points is that it expands on the use of `+`
in ggplot2 to allow plots to be added together and composed, creating a
natural extension of the {**ggplot2**} API.

While quite complex compositions can be achieved using `+`, `|`, and
`/`, it may be necessary to take even more control over the layout. All
of this can be controlled using the `patchwork::plot_layout()` function
along with a couple of special placeholder objects.

The readxl package makes it easy to get data out of Excel and into R.
Compared to many of the existing packages (e.g. {**gdata**}, {**xlsx**},
{**xlsReadWrite**}) {**readxl**} has no external dependencies, so it’s
easy to install and use on all operating systems. It is designed to work
with *tabular* data. Works on Windows, Mac and Linux without external
dependencies.
:::

{**readxl**} supports both the legacy `.xls` format and the modern
xml-based `.xlsx` format. The embedded
[libxls](https://github.com/libxls/libxls) C library is used to support
`.xls`, which abstracts away many of the complexities of the underlying
binary format. To parse `.xlsx`, we use the
[RapidXML](https://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/) C++ library.

Visualizations](https://cinc.rud.is/web/packages/waffle/index.html)

(*There is no hexagon logo for {**waffle**} available*)

Square pie charts (a.k.a. waffle charts) can be used to communicate
parts of a whole for categorical quantities. To emulate the percentage
view of a pie chart, a 10x10 grid should be used with each square
representing 1% of the total.

Modern uses of waffle charts do not necessarily adhere to this rule and
can be created with a grid of any rectangular shape.

Best practices suggest keeping the number of categories small, just as
should be done when creating pie charts.

Tools are provided to create waffle charts as well as stitch them
together, and to use glyphs for making isotype pictograms.

It uses {**ggplot2**} and returns a `ggplot2` object.
