WATCH OUT: This is my personal learning material and is therefore
neither an accurate replication nor an authoritative textbook.
:::

::: my-watch-out-container
I wrote this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to
become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more carefully.
Please keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a
learner.

Text passages with content I am already familiar I have skipped. Section
of the original text where I needed more in-depth knowledge I have
elaborated and added my own comments resulted from my personal research.

Be warned! In spite of replicating most of the content this Quarto book
may contain many mistakes. All the misapprehensions and errors are of
course my own responsibility.

## Content and Goals of this Book {.unnumbered}

This Quarto book collects my personal notes, trials and exercises of
[Statistics With R: Solving Problems Using Real-World
Data](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/statistics-with-r/book253567) by
Jenine K. Harris [@harris2020].

This introductory textbook for Statistics with R has three outstanding
features:

### Data Wrangling

The book applies real data sets with all their problems: missing data,
inconsistent structure, not appropriate data types, not understandable
labels, accompanying extensive code books etc. Data management is
therefore a major part of the book, a subject often not taught. Many
introductory textbooks work with already cleaned data and miss the
necessity to guide students to bring messy data into an analyzable form.

### Inclusion

The author aims to support women and other underrepresented groups to
pursue a data science career. By choosing a narrative style with three
prototypical feminine characters the book discusses the approaches not
only in details but also shows the effect of not optimal coding
solutions. The solutions are developed step by step and each improvement
replicates the code already written. These repetitions helps not only to
compare the differences but shows that code has to be developed bit by
bit, tested, improved, and tested again. Another interesting practice
shown in the book is to try different approaches to the same problem and
the re-usability of already written code. All these practices help to
lower barriers and to facilitate learning statistics with R.

### Compelling social science topics

The three characters (Leslie a statistics student, who wants to learn R;
Nancy an experienced data scientist and coding specialist; Kiara a data
management guru worried especially about reproducibility) discuss
real-world problem analysis from different angles. Every chapter starts
with a short introduction about the background of the social problem the
text is going to analyze. By introducing using publicly available data
sources that have to be modified and cleaned one learns very important
transferable skills. After working through the book it should be easy to
work on his/her own research questions using public data sets.

## Text passages

### Quotes and personal comments

My text consists mostly of quotes from the first edition of Harris’
book. I converted my kindle book into a PDF file which I copied via the
annotation system in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) into my Quarto
files.

::: my-example
::: my-example-header
::: {#exm-preface-quote}
: Quote
:::
:::

::: my-example-container
> “NA is a reserved “word” in R. In order to use NA, both letters must
> be uppercase (Na or na does not work), and there can be no quotation
> marks (R will treat “NA” as a character rather than a true missing
> value)” ([Harris, 2020, p.
> 121](zotero://select/groups/5254842/items/9N29QMJB))
> ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5254842/items/3NDRGBBW?page=121&annotation=XBYU53LG))
:::
:::

@exm-preface-quote has links to my PDF and also to my annotation of the
PDF. These links are a practical way for me to get the context of the
quote. But as the linked PDF is saved locally at my hard disk these
links do not work for you! (There is an option about [Zotero
groups](https://www.zotero.org/groups) to share files, but the PDF is
not free to use and so I can't offer this possibility.)

Often I made minor editing (e.g., shorting the text) or put the content
in my own wording. In this case I couldn't quote the text as it does not
represent a specific annotation in my Zotero file. In this case I ended
the paraphrase with `(Harris ibid.)`.

In any case most of the text in this Quarto book is not mine but coming
from different resources (Harris’ book, R help files, websites). Most of
the time I have put my own personal notes into a notes box as shown in
@exm-preface-note.

::: my-example
::: my-example-header
::: {#exm-preface-note}
: Personal note
:::
:::

::: my-example-container
::: my-note
::: my-note-header
::: {#cor-preface-note-example}
: This is a personal note
:::
:::

::: my-note-container
In this kind of box I will write my personal thoughts and reflections.
Usually this box will appear stand-alone (without the wrapping example
box).
:::

### Glossary

I am also using links to overlaid glossary entries. If you hover with
your mouse over the double underlined links it opens an window with the
appropriate glossary text. Try this example: `r glossary("Centering")`.

::: my-watch-out
::: my-watch-out-header
WATCH OUT! Glossary text not authorized by the author of SWR
:::

::: my-watch-out-container
::: {layout="[10, 30]" layout-valign="center"}
![](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/logo.png)

I have added many of the glossary entries when I was working through
other books either taking the text passage of these books I was reading
or via an internet recherche from other resources. I have added the
source of glossary entry. Sometimes I have used abbreviation, but I need
still to provide a key what this short references mean.
:::

Jenine Harris has collected her own glossary. Where ever it is suitable
for my learning path I have added her entries into my dictionary. To
apply the glossary into this text I have used the {**glossary**} package
by [Lisa DeBruine](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/index.html).
:::
:::

If you fork the [repository of this quarto
book](https://github.com/petzi53/swr-harris) then the glossary will not
work out of the box. Load down the `glossary.yml` file from [my
glossary-pb GitHub
repo](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml),
store it on your hard disk and change the path in the code chunk
@lst-preview-load-glossary.

In any case I am the only responsible person for this text, especially
if I have used code from the resources wrongly or misunderstood a quoted
text passage.

## R Code and Datasets

Harris provides R code and datasets via her [Github
site](https://github.com/jenineharris/statistics-in-R-data-sets) but you
can also download these files directly from the [Student
Resources](https://edge.sagepub.com/harris1e/student-resources/datasets-and-r-code)
of the publisher's SAGE website.

Harris introduces and uses in the book [Google’s R Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html) with camelCase.
The reference is pointing to a fork of the [Tidyverse Style
Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). I am going to use underscore (`_`)
or [snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) to replace
spaces as studies has shown that it is easier to read [@sharif2010]. But
I will use the other Google modifications from the tidyverse style
guide:

-   Start the names of private functions with a dot.
-   Don't use `attach()`.
-   No right-hand assignments.
-   Use explicit returns.
-   Qualify namespace.

Especially the last point (qualifying namespace) is important for my
learning. Besides preventing conflicts with functions of identical names
from different packages it helps to learn (or remember) which function
belongs to which package. I think this justifies the small overhead and
helps to make R code chunks self-sufficient. (No previous package
loading, or library calls in the setup chunk.) To foster learning the
relation between function and package I embrace the package name with
curly brakes and format it in bold.

I am using the package name also for the default installation of base R.
This wouldn't be necessary but it helps me to understand where the base
R functions come from. What follows is a list of base R packages of the
system library included into every installation and attached (opened) by
default:

-   {**base**}: The R Base Package
-   {**datsets**}: The R Datasets Package
-   {**graphics**}: The R Graphics Package
-   {**grDevices**}: The R Graphics Devices and Support for Colours and
    Fonts
-   {**methods**}: Formal Methods and Classes
-   {**stats**}: The R Stats Package
-   {**utils**}: The R Utils Package

I am not using always the exact code snippets for my replications
because I am not only replicating the code to see how it works but also
to change the values of parameters to observe their influences.

In "Statistics with R" there are all names of function arguments explicitly mentioned. This is also the case for function with just one argument, for instance `base::summary(object = <r object to summarize>)`. When it is clear then I will follow the advice from Hadley Wickham:

> When you call a function, you typically omit the names of data arguments, because they are used so commonly. If you override the default value of an argument, use the full name ([tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html)).

For educational reasons Harris develops code step by step and replicates
the complete code including the previous — already explained — snippets.
In these cases I use tabs as an organizing structure so that one can see
(and compare) the piecemeal development.
